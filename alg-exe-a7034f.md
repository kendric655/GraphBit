alg.exe is a legitimate Windows system file associated with the Application Layer Gateway Service, which is part of the Windows operating system developed by Microsoft, specifically version 10.0.15063.0. This executable file plays a crucial role in enabling certain network connection features, particularly those related to firewalls and Internet Connection Sharing. Generally, alg.exe is safe to run on your system; however, like any system file, it can be mimicked by malware, so it's essential to ensure that it is located in the correct directory (C:\Windows\System32) to confirm its authenticity. Users may encounter errors related to alg.exe, often manifesting as connectivity issues or problems with certain network applications, but these can typically be resolved by restarting the Application Layer Gateway Service or the system itself. In summary, while alg.exe serves a vital function in Windows networking, vigilance is necessary to ensure it is not a disguised form of malware.
