afwServ.exe is a process associated with Avast Internet Security, developed by Avast Software, and is part of the software's firewall component designed to protect users from unauthorized access and potential threats. The version 19.8.4793.0 of this executable file is generally considered safe, as it is a legitimate part of the Avast software suite; however, like many executable files, it can sometimes trigger false positives in antivirus scans or be mimicked by malware, so it's essential for users to ensure that it is located in the correct directory (typically within the Avast installation folder) to confirm its authenticity. Errors related to afwServ.exe may include issues with the Avast firewall not functioning properly, which could result in connectivity problems or alerts about the service being unable to start, and users experiencing such issues are advised to check for updates or reinstall the software to resolve potential conflicts or corruption.
